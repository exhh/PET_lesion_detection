# PET_lesion_detection
This code is used to detect neuroendocrine tumors/lesions on positron emission tomorgraphy (PET) images with 3D deep learning-based location aware encoding. The code is implemented with PyTorch (version 1.10.1, https://pytorch.org/) on a Ubuntu Linux machine.

Usage (please refer to the paper below for the details of data format):

For training: ./train_detection.sh

For testing: ./eval_detection.sh
